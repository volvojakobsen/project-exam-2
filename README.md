A exam project for my 4th semester at Noroff fagskole.

Holidaze Is a site where users can find venues for renting and staying at.
A registered customer is able to book a stay at the venues on this site.
People can also register as a venue manager and rent out their own venues on this site.

## Description

The goal with this project was to build a fronted project using react and a framework for styling, i went with styled-components for this.
One of the requirements was that the user should be able to view available dates for the venues on a calendar. For this i tried many different calendars but eventually landed on using react-day-picker.
The styling is done with Styled-Components
